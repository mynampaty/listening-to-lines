after eons, life begins anew.

the fruit of _karma_, in essence.  

What is Hel? It’s been said:  
Hel is a ride away on bus 666,  
among resorts, one of the top picks.  

What is hell? It’s been said:  
hell is other people in the room,   
sharing the no-exit sense of gloom.  

What is hell? It’s been said:  
Hell is the person you are, comfortable in your skin,  
one day meeting the person you could have been.
