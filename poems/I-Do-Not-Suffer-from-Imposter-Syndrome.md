# I Do Not Suffer from Imposter Syndrome 
_A student’s pantoum_

Unlike all of my fellow classmates,  
and many poets who came before me,  
I do not suffer from imposter syndrome.  
I’m a polymath and well-versed in many fields.   

Many poets came before me.  
Many were ordained as masters.   
I’m a polymath, well-versed in many fields,  
with special expertise in the Dunning-Krueger effect.   

Many were ordained as masters.  
Many were graced by the muse.  
Despite my Dunning-Krueger expertise,   
I still failed to entice the muse this year.  

Many were graced by the muse.   
I have prayed and sought her blessings  
but still failed to entice her this year.  
I saw her long, long ago but am still beguiled.  

I have prayed and sought her blessings.  
I yearn for her company like a lovesick teen.  
I saw her long, long ago and am still beguiled.  
Perhaps she needed some distance from me?  

I yearn for her company like a lovesick teen.  
Perhaps she was a mere object of limerence  
who clearly needed some distance from me.  
But I did not let her absence stall my progress.  

Perhaps she was a mere object of limerence  
but to my credit I bashed on regardless.  
I did not let her absence stall my progress.  
And, no, I did not indulge in opium tinctures.  

To my credit I bashed on regardless.  
Line by line, I forged my poems  
without indulging in opium tinctures.  
I outhustled my own doubts and fears.  

Line by line, I forged my poems.  
I laid claim to my place as a poet.  
I outhustled my own doubts and fears.  
I dare say I hustled masterfully.  

I lay claim to my place as a poet.  
I have done some of what they all did.  
I dare say I did this masterfully.  
I did this because I have something to say.  

I have done some of what they all did,  
Tagore, Heaney, Tabrizi, et al.  
I did this because I have something to say  
before the candle finally goes out.  

Tagore, Heaney, Tabrizi, et al. :  
they had the talent, but I have the hustle.  
Before the candle finally goes out  
there's a place for me on that library shelf.  

They have the talent; I have the hustle and  
I’m aware of all my afflictions. So I know  
there’s place for me on that library shelf  
for this very simple reason.  

I’m aware of all my afflictions so I know  
I do not suffer from imposter syndrome.  
I know this for a very simple reason:  
Unlike all of my fellow classmates  

I am truly an imposter.
