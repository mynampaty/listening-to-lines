#Summer

Summer is a seductress smoking.  
Hot and radiant, she’s a wild fire.  
Perspiration glistens, she’s totally sizzling.  
Summer is a seductress, smoking  
and sultry. She’s the solstice light, blinding  
men to every other object they desire.  
Summer is a seductress, smoking  
hot and radiant. She’s a wildfire.
