# The Hunger Game 
_Loosely translated from Chandrabose's original Telugu_  

All hunger is a raging flame.  
Even the leaves devour sunlight,  
And the hunter consumes his game.  

A lamb munches leaves without shame,  
And a lion devours a lamb at first sight.  
All hunger is a raging flame.  

Death conquers a lion however tame.  
Time vanquishes death, they write,  
And the hunter consumes his game.  

Doomed is the predator who misses his aim,  
Doomed as a wounded prey in a state of fright.  
All hunger is a raging flame.  

Worms are bait for fish in the same  
Way seed is bait for birds in flight.  
And the hunter consumes his game.  

Temptation is bait for men, it's claimed.  
Ritual sacrifice is just bait for God, right?   
All hunger is a raging flame,  
And the hunter consumes his game.
