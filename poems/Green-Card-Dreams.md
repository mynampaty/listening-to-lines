# Green Card Dreams

There was a man from Madras,  
Who was at the top of his class,  
When a thought began to grow,  
To America he must go!  
The land of milk and honey,  
And pockets full of money.  
So he went to the consulate,  
And was so very fortunate,  
The officer approved his visa.  
He celebrated with a tequila,  
And boarded an airplane.  
(â€˜Twas too far for a train.)  
He studied on weekends,  
Burned candles at both ends,  
To graduate with distinction,  
Which advanced his ambition,  
Of finding gainful employment,  
Even a residency permanent!   
Work he always did revere,  
And so began his career,  
At a hi-tech company,  
In the Land of the Free.  
Although the process was hard,  
In time, he applied for a Green Card.  
As a candidate of high quality,  
The process was a mere formality.  
Or so he naively thought,  
But his plans, they came to naught.  
Turns out there is a country-wise quota,  
The logic for which there is not one iota.   
The wait became interminable,  
With end-dates quite unpredictable.  
A decade ran its course,  
Without mercy or remorse.  
There was no end in sight,  
And his anxiety was at its height.  
Now the man is back in Madras,  
Sans green card, alas.
