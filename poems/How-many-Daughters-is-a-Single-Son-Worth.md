# How many Daughters is a Single Son Worth?  

How true is the dictum that  
many deaths is a statistic. Saying    
daughters are our princesses   
is a deception. Often sheâ€™s seen as   
a dynastic burden each    
single day, unwanted, and unlike a  
son who is preferred not just by patriarchs. His  
worth? In excess of one hundred million.
